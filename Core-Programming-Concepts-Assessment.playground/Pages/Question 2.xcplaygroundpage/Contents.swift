 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**

let bookName = "How To Get 100% In This Assesment"
print("This is a constant because the book name will not change")
var numberOfCopiesSold = 10000000000001
print("This is a variable because the number sold will likely change")
let authorOfBook = "Octavio Diaz"
print("This is a constant because the author of the book name will not change")
var sugestedSellingPrice = 20000000000000
print("This is a variable because the price will likely change")
let yearPublished = 2018
print("This is a constant because the year published will not change")

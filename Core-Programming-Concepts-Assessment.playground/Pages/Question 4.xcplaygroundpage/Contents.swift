        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.

 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**

// Answer question 4 below
var numberOfAppsUsedToday : Int
print("I chose integer as a data type to describe this because the number of apps opened can not be a decimal")
var totalNumberofHoursThatScreenWasOn : Double
print("I chose double as a data type to describe this because the hours the screen was on can be a number with a decimal")
var mostPopularApp : String
print("I chose string as a data type to describe this because the most popular app's name is described with words")
let currentDate : String
print("I chose string as a data type to describe this because the most current date is described with words and numbers")
